Welcome to the Basil training. 

This training has been designed to explain the basics of Basil and how to use it in a stand-alone environment to generate Docker and Singularity images. The training is divided into 5 levels with increasing level of complexity. Each module has a README file that explains the concepts and a hands-on exercise to practice the concepts. The training is designed to be self-paced and one can take as much time as you need to complete the training. 

Requirements:
* You should have a basic understanding of Linux commands.
* You should have a basic understanding of a programming language.
* You should have Docker and Singularity installed on the system on which you would like to run the Docker/Singularity images generated by basil.

Note for Windows/Mac users: We do not support MacOS/WindowsOS base images. To work on the training, you can run an Ubuntu container and work on the training. To run an Ubuntu container, run the command below after replacing <PATH_TO_BASIL_TRAINING_DIRECTORY> with the path to the basil training directory.
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v <PATH_TO_BASIL_TRAINING_DIRECTORY>:/training ubuntu
```
